A database of characters, episodes, and guests for the podcast, *Comedy Bang! Bang!*. 

## Purpose
My goal was to scrape *Comedy Bang! Bang!* episode, character, and guest data automatically from both the RSS feed and Earwolf website. In its current state, this program can parse episode and guest data and link guests to episodes, but unfortunately relies on manual entry for all character data.

## Data Sources
- [Earwolf](https://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/)
- [Unofficial RSS Feed for Stitcher Premium](https://unofficialrss.com/feed/96916)
